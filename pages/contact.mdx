Before contacting us, please have a look at the Q&A section for commonly asked questions: 

## What is Strata Property Ownership?
Strata property ownership involves individual ownership of a unit or lot within a building or complex, along with shared ownership of common areas. These common areas might include hallways, elevators, gardens, and other communal spaces. Strata ownership is common in apartments, townhouses, and mixed-use developments.

## How are levies calculated?
Levies are calculated based on the proportion of ownership a unit owner has in the building. This is often determined by the unit entitlement, which represents the percentage of the total building's value that the unit owner holds. The levy amount helps to cover the costs of building maintenance, insurance, and other shared expenses.

## How often are levies due?
Typically, levies are due on a quarterly basis. However, the frequency and amount of levies can vary depending on the strata agreement for your building. The Strata Committee decides on the levy amount based on the buildingâ€™s financial needs.

## How do I make a maintenance request?
Maintenance requests can be submitted directly through the Strata Management Portal. Unit owners can fill out a form specifying the nature of the issue, and the Strata Committee will review and assign the request accordingly. You will also be updated on the status of your request (e.g., in progress, completed, denied).

## Can I view the financial status of my building?
Yes! As a unit owner, you can view important financial documents such as budgets, levy statements, and reports on the overall financial health of your building. These can be accessed through the portal for transparency and easy tracking.

## What happens if a maintenance request is denied?
If a maintenance request is denied, the unit owner will be notified with a reason for the decision. This can be due to factors like budget constraints, non-urgent issues, or requests that fall outside of the scope of the building's responsibilities.
